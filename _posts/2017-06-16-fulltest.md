### Let's try it

Hints:
- Inputs can go to multiple gates!
- Gate outputs can be inputs for other gates!

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#008080" -->

### Alarm System

<div style="font-size:x-large">
<p/>I want an alarm system that will trigger if someone tries to enter my house through my window. There are two components:

<ul> 
    <li/>A sensor on the window that will detect if it is jiggled
    <li/> A pressure plate that will detect if someone is standing in front of the window
</ul>
<p/>Sometimes the wind blows and jiggles the window and sometimes a squirrel may jump on the pressure plate. Account for this.

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#288080" -->
### Alarm v2

I'm always forgetting my keys and need to break in through my window. I have a Fob that can identify that it's me trying to get in. Redesign the system so it doesn't go off if I'm trying to get in the window.

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#488080" -->
### A new gate

Design a circuit that will behave like the following truth table:

| A | B | Output |
--- | --- | --- |
| False | False | False |
| True | False | True |
| False | True | True |
| True | True | False |

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#688080" -->
### A real challenge

Design a logic circuit that can add two 1-bit numbers

![forcebewithyou](img/maytheforce.gif)

---

### Let's look at some real code

```sql
SELECT *
FROM dim_driver
WHERE source != 'A' OR source != 'B'
```

Does this work as intended?

## Break time!

## A brief tour of code

We've seen how computers use logic gates in their hardware to process binary instructions. Raw binary (usually displayed in hex code) is often referred to as **machine code**

```
8B542408 83FA0077 06B80000 0000C383
FA027706 B8010000 00C353BB 01000000
B9010000 008D0419 83FA0376 078BD989
C14AEBF1 5BC3
```

We don't want to code this way...

--

## A level up

In the early days of computer science we figured out how to reduce this complexity a bit, using what we call **assembly code.**

--

<div style="font-size:x-large">
    <pre><code>
        mov edx, [esp+8]
        cmp edx, 0
        ja @f
        mov eax, 0
        ret
        
        @@:
        cmp edx, 2
        ja @f
        mov eax, 1
        ret
        
        @@:
        push ebx
        mov ebx, 1
        mov ecx, 1
        
        @@:
            lea eax, [ebx+ecx]
            cmp edx, 3
            jbe @f
            mov ebx, ecx
            mov ecx, eax
            dec edx
        jmp @b
        
        @@:
        pop ebx
        ret
    </code></pre>
</div>

This is better, but not by a whole lot...

--

## Another level up

Things got interesting when we figured out how to create more human-readable languages that could then be *compiled* into assembly code. <br><br>These are now known as **high level languages.** Examples include C, Java, etc.

--

<div style="font-size:xx-large">
    <pre><code>
        unsigned int fib(unsigned int n) {
            if (n <= 0)
                return 0;
            else if (n <= 2)
                return 1;
            else {
                unsigned int a,b,c;
                a = 1;
                b = 1;
                while (1) {
                    c = a + b;
                    if (n <= 3) return c;
                    a = b;
                    b = c;
                    n--;
                }
            }
        }
    </code></pre>
</div>

Much (?) better!

<!-- .slide: data-background="#ed2939" -->
<p style="color:black">All of computer science can be boiled down to one big idea: <b>Abstraction</b></p>

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#008080" -->

...but what instructions do we give?

---

## Algorithms

Very basically, an algorithm is a set of instructions that accomplishes a specific task.

<br>

---

## Big O Notation

- We can evaluate how "good" an algorithm is by thinking broadly about how many steps, or *operations* it takes to complete 
- We then may want to consider how well it scales based on the size of the object we're acting upon
- This is often expressed as $O(n)$

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="img/bigo.png" data-background-transition="convex"  -->

<h3 style="color:black">Operations matter</h3>

--

### The phone book example

![phonebook](/img/telephone_book.jpeg)

---

### Sorting

Since it's so important, let's examine sorting algorithms more closely. First up is an early sorting algorithm called "Bubble Sort"

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="img/bubble-sort.gif"  data-background-transition="convex" -->

--

...While simple, this is not a great algorithm. It runs in $O(n^2)$.
<br><br>

Let's examine another algorithm called Merge Sort

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="img/merge-sort.gif"  data-background-transition="convex" -->

--

This is significantly better. It runs in $O(n \log n)$.
<br><br>

It accomplishes this by employing a **divide and conquer** strategy.

---

<!-- .slide: data-background="#008080" -->

## Let's try it!

Think programmatically, but don't worry about writing valid code. You can use plain English.

--

### Find a Sum

<!-- .slide: data-background="#008080" -->

Given an array of numbers $\alpha[]$ and a number $\beta$ design an algorithm that will return two numbers in $\alpha$ that sum to $\beta$ (or returns 0 if no such sum exists)

---

### Do you really need to know this??

...No. This level of complexity has mostly been abstracted away, which is a good thing.
<br><br>
But you may end up getting a Big O notation question during a technical interview, so best be prepared...

---

## Next time...

We'll be discussing tools!

- command line!
- text editors!
- Linux!!! 
- Why IDEs are bad for you! (so controversial!)

We'll be setting you up with the tools and environment you need to get shit done.

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#008080" -->

Fair warning: OSX users are going to have a much easier time. Windows users... it's okay, we'll figure it out... probably...
