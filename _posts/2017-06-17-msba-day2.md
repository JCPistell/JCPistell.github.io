Here are the slides from our second bonus session, focused on the basics of using the command line to get things done.

This deck is built around using bash, the most common command-line shell you will encounter. Windows users, as we discussed during the session, if you want to follow along you'll need to figure out how get bash running on your system. The easiest way is to use Virtualbox/Vagrant and the [Vagrantfile](https://github.com/JCPistell/msba_vagrantfile) I provided.

Once the slides were done we focused on tool setup, including mysql workbench and a few R packages. I will cover those topics in a separate post.

If you want to truly nerd out on using the command line for data analysis I would recommend [Data Science at the Command Line](http://datascienceatthecommandline.com/) by Jeroen Janssens.
