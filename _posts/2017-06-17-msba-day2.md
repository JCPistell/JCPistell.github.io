Hey folks - here are the slides from the second day of the bonus sessions:

This deck is built around using bash, the most common command-line shell you will encounter. Windows users, as we discussed during the session, if you want to follow along you'll need to figure out how get bash running on your system. The easiest way is to use Virtualbox/Vagrant and the [Vagrantfile](https://github.com/JCPistell/msba_vagrantfile) I provided.

Once the slides were done we focused on tool setup, including mysql workbench and a few R packages. I will cover those topics in a seperate post.
