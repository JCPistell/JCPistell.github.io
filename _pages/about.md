Continuously improving and Mostly Harmless.

I do things with computers and sometimes they work. Originally from New England, with long stints in Los Angeles, CA and Chapel Hill, NC. Now living in Denver, CO.

I'm a consultant for DAS42, a data analytics consultancy that provides full stack analytics services.
